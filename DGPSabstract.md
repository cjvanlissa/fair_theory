We introduce the concept of FAIR theories to reimagine theories as more dynamic, evolving entities that can be collaboratively developed and refined, leading to a more robust and interconnected body of scientific knowledge.
To that end, we propose a framework for the collaborative creation, maintenance, and evolution of FAIR theories that enables truly cumulative science.
We conceptualize theories as the primary vehicle for knowledge acquisition in the empirical cycle of deduction and induction.
As such, cumulative science requires clarity about how theories evolve in relation to their own history, empirical data, and other theories.
Such clarity is crucial for understanding the distinct paths theories may take in the empirical cycle, whether they are predictive, explanatory, or descriptive in nature.
Tracking this evolution requires representing theories as digital objects formulated in more or less formal languages (i.e., formulas, mathematical/statistical models, computer programs, nomological networks, or operational definitions).
In our framework, the history of the theory is tracked using version control, its relation to empirical data with semantic versioning, and the relation between theories with universally unique identifiers.
Combining these identifiers with rich metadata makes a FAIR theory findable; version control systems tracking the metadata make it accessible; the formal languages make it interoperable; and well-defined procedures for changing and amending theories make it reusable.
These FAIR theory guiding principles precede implementation and are tailored to accommodate the varied ways in which different theories contribute to the empirical cycle.
Still, we provide examples to demonstrate the utility of FAIR theories.
