We introduce the concept of FAIR theories, reimagining theories as dynamic, evolving entities collaboratively developed and refined, thus contributing to a more robust and interconnected body of scientific knowledge. 
Theories help to structure and condense the existing scientific knowledge, yet their development often lacks structure.
We introduce FAIR theories in the hopes that a more structured approach enables more cumulative science. 
Central to our proposal is representing theories as digital objects, expressed in various formal languages, including formulas, mathematical/statistical models, computer programs, nomological networks, or operational definitions. 
However, digital representation is not enough; in our framework, the theory's history is tracked using version control, changes in empirical content with semantic versioning, and the relation between theories with universally unique identifiers. 
Combining these identifiers with rich metadata makes a FAIR theory Findable; version control systems tracking it and the metadata make it Accessible; the formal languages make it Interoperable; and well-defined procedures for changing and amending theories make it Reusable. 
FAIR theories facilitate metascientific insights into the evolution of theories and their empirical underpinnings.
Moving forward, we envision theories undergoing "integration tests against reality", paralleling continuous integration in software development by continuously evaluating the empirical foundations of theories, akin to living meta-analyses.
This presentation addresses the guiding principles of FAIR theory and provides specific implementation examples.
