Many meta‐scientific initiatives have focused on enhancing the rigor of theory testing, yet the systematic specification of theories remains underdeveloped.
We present FAIR theory, a new approach that transforms scientific theories into digital, evolving artifacts—developed collaboratively—to bolster the robustness and interconnectedness of scientific knowledge.
By representing theories as formal, machine‐readable objects (e.g., mathematical models, computer code, nomological networks, or explicit operational definitions) and tracking their evolution through version control and semantic versioning, FAIR theory provides a structured, cumulative framework for theory development.
We propose that each theory is assigned a universally unique identifier and enriched with detailed metadata, ensuring it is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
This digital infrastructure addresses a critical gap in scholarly practice by introducing the collaborative tools and standards for theory specification that have already revolutionized methodology, data sharing, and publishing.
Ultimately, FAIR theory aims to transform how scientific ideas are communicated, evaluated, and iteratively refined, thereby accelerating cumulative knowledge acquisition across disciplines.
