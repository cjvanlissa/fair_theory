Innovations in open science and meta-science have focused on rigorous *theory testing*,
yet methods for specifying, sharing, and iteratively improving theories remain underdeveloped.
To address these limitations, we introduce *FAIR theory*:
A standard for specifying theories as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable information artifacts.
FAIR theories are Findable in well-established archives,
Accessible in terms of availability and their ability to be understood,
Interoperable for specific purposes, such as selecting control variables,
and
Reusable so that they can be iteratively improved through collaborative efforts.
[This paper adapts the FAIR principles for theory,
reflects on FAIR practices in contemporary psychology,
introduces a workflow for FAIRifying theory, which is largely automated by the `theorytools` R-package]{#abstractpackage},
and discusses FAIR theories’ potential impact in terms of reducing research waste,
enabling meta-research on theories' structure and development,
and incorporating theory into reproducible research workflows – from hypothesis generation to simulation studies.
FAIR theory constitutes a protocol for archiving and communicating about theory, addressing a critical gap in open scholarly practices and supporting the renewed interest in theory development in psychology and beyond.
FAIR theory builds on existing open science principles and infrastructures to provide a structured, cumulative framework for theory development, potentially increasing efficiency and potentially accelerating the pace of cumulative knowledge acquisition.
