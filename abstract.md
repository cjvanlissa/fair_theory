Innovations in open science and meta-science have focused on rigorous *theory testing*,
yet methods for specifying, sharing, and iteratively improving theories remain underdeveloped.
To address these limitations, we introduce *FAIR theory*:
A standard for specifying theories as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable information artifacts.
FAIR theories are Findable in well-established archives,
Accessible in terms of availability and their ability to be understood,
Interoperable for specific purposes, such as selecting control variables,
and
Reusable so that they can be iteratively improved through collaborative efforts.
This paper adapts the FAIR principles for theory,
reflects on current FAIR practices in relation to psychological theory,
and discusses FAIR theories’ potential impact in terms of reducing research waste,
enabling meta-research on theories' structure and development,
and incorporating theory into reproducible research workflows – from hypothesis generation to simulation studies.
[We present a conceptual workflow for FAIRifying theory in this paper,
which builds on existing open science principles and infrastructures.
More detailed tutorials, worked examples, and convenience functions to automate this workflow are available in the `theorytools` R-package.]{#abstractpackage}
FAIR theory constitutes a structured protocol for archiving, communicating about, and iteratively improving theory,
addressing a critical gap in open scholarly practices and 
potentially increasing the efficiency of cumulative knowledge acquisition in psychology and beyond.
