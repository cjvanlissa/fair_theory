Innovations in open science and meta-science have focused on rigorous *theory testing*,
yet methods for the specification, sharing, and iterative improvement of theories remain underdeveloped.
We introduce *FAIR theory* to address this issue,
applying the FAIR principles to theory specification.
FAIR theories are Findable in well-established open science archives (e.g., Zenodo),
Accessible in practical terms (e.g., human- and machine-readable file formats) and in terms of their ability to be understood,
Interoperable for specific purposes, e.g., to guide selection of control variables in analyses,
and Reusable such that they can be iteratively improved, while their provenance is tracked through version control with Git.
# machine- and human-readable information artefacts (e.g., propositions in plain text, mathematical formulae, computer code).
# We make extensive use of well-established open science infrastructure (Git for version control, Zenodo for archival and search indexing) to implement FAIR theories as well-specified, evolving artifacts that invite iterative improvement through collaborative effort.
This paper adapts the FAIR priciples for theory,
reflects on the FAIRness of contemporary practices in psychological theory,
introduces a workflow for FAIRifying theory,
and discusses the affordances of FAIR theory, for example

â€”to bolster the robustness and interconnectedness of scientific knowledge.
By representing theories as 

and tracking their evolution through version control and semantic versioning,
FAIR theory provides a structured, cumulative framework for theory development.
We propose that each theory is assigned a universally unique identifier and enriched with detailed metadata, ensuring it is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
This digital infrastructure addresses a critical gap in scholarly practice by introducing the collaborative tools and standards for theory specification that have already revolutionized methodology, data sharing, and publishing.

Ultimately, FAIR theory aims to increase the efficiency with which scientific ideas are communicated, evaluated, and iteratively refined,
thereby accelerating cumulative knowledge acquisition.
