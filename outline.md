FAIR Theory: A Digital Format for Social Scientific Theories to Facilitate Cumulative Knowledge Acquisition

* Theory is the vehicle of cumulative knowledge acquisition
* According to the empirical cycle, ideally, hypotheses are derived from theory, then tested in data, and theory is ammended based on the resulting insights. When this cycle is regularly completed, theories become ever more veracious representations of social scientific phenomena.
* At present, there is concern over a theory crisis in the social sciences, which highlights that this system is not functioning as intended, and highlights the need for better theory.
* One source of potential improvements of theory methodology that has not been previously considered is computer science.
* The process of "iteratively improving" digital objects - in this case, computer code - is well understood.
* Recent work like the FAIR software principles has demonstrated that ideals of open science apply to computer science as well.
* This paper argues that, conversely, principles of computer science - particularly version control, algorithmic hypothesis generation (find better word; this is about using the digital theory object to derive implied hypotheses), and integrated testing, can also be used to improve theory methods in the social science.
* We introduce "FAIR theory", a digital research artifact to represent formal social scientific theories
* FAIR theory can be version controlled; any time new insights require modifications of the theory, these modifications can be documented in a traceable and reversable manner. Version control also enables diffuse collaboration in theory development, as other researchers can submit "pull requests" to suggest modifications of a theory, or can "fork" existing theories to create a spin-off from an existing theory.
* FAIR theory allows for algorithmic derivation of hypotheses implied by the theory.
* FAIR theory enables integration testing: researchers can build a "test suite" of evidence that must be explainable by the theory, and any modifications of the theory must also pass the test suite.
* To illustrate FAIR theory's potential to accellerate cumulative knowledge acquisition, we present several tutorial examples, developed in collaboration with applied researchers across fields of social science.
