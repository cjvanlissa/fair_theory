# Wagenmakers' version; "We added the Whewell-Peirce-Reichenbach distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification."

digraph {

  subgraph cluster_discovery {
    label="Discovery";
    hypothesis [label="New hypothesis"];
    prediction [label="New prediction"];
  }
  data  [label="Old knowledge and old data"];      
  subgraph cluster_justification {
    label="Justification";
    test [label="Test on new data"];
    evaluation;
  }

  data -> hypothesis [label="Speculate & explore"];
  hypothesis -> prediction  [label="Deduce"];
  prediction -> test  [label="Design new experiment"];
  test -> evaluation  [label="Statistical analysis"];
  evaluation -> data  [label="Knowledge accumulation"];

}

# Caspar's take

digraph {

  theory;
  prediction;
  test [label="inferential procedure"];
  data;
  results;
  
  theory -> prediction [label="deduction"];
  prediction -> test;
  data -> results;
  test -> results  [label="inference"];
  results -> theory [label="induction"];

}

# And then for example: I understand Aaron's work about inductive bias to be about the link "prediction -> test;", because the test is not identified without making auxiliary assumptions; if the auxiliary assumption is made based on the data, inductive bias is introduced.
