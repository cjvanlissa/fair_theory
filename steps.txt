# Tutorial: Making Theory FAIR

Open science infrastructure is an area of active development, and as such,
the approach proposed here should not be considered definitive,
but rather, as a proposal for a FAIR-compliant implementation of theory using infrastructure available at the time of writing.
The `worcs` R-package documentation contains a digital version of this tutorial,
to allow for future updates.

1. Create project folder
1. Add theory file
1. Add LICENSE file
1. Add readme.md
    * Include project Title, Description, Usage of the theory file, How to Contribute, How to Cite the FAIR theory, Related Works (e.g., the paper that documents the theory)
1. Add .zenodo.json file to provide metadata that will allow Zenodo to index the repository as a FAIR theory
1. Initialize a Git repository in the project folder
1. Create Git remote repository (e.g., on GitHub)
1. Connect local to remote Git repository
1. Add the repository to Zenodo
    * Sync Zenodo to import recent GitHub repositories (may take some time before it shows)
    * Flip Switch
1. Publish a release on GitHub
1. *Optional:* Edit Zenodo metadata (e.g., to add formal cross-references to related works) https://help.zenodo.org/docs/deposit/manage-records/#edit
