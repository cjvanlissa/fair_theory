Version controllable specification for theory development and adjudication.

* Discuss collaboration
* Discuss platforms
* Discuss adjudication

1. Find suitable examples
	+ Augmented Causal Loop Diagrams https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35549316/
	+ Theory maps https://static1.squarespace.com/static/586fd7e2ff7c5060b1f0f079/t/5872c87b1b10e33462c9bc16/1483917435347/Lindquist--Emotion.pdf
	+ Maybe also this one, considering Gray is a co-author so it's probably well aligned with their vision for these maps: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/586fd7e2ff7c5060b1f0f079/t/58715ca9725e2549f7a7544e/1483824297358/Waytz+%26+Gray--Mind+Perception.pdf
	+ Predator/prey model? Ising model? Something mathematic
2. Find suitable language
3. One-page introduction

* Project: endless
	+ Maintaining software
* Has to be different from statistical model
	+ But still formal
	+ DAG? Function?
* Theorymaps.org website
* Add version control on top of Theorymaps.org
* Applied example, translated into our language

* Relations between elements of a theory
	+ But also relations between theories

* Hashmap / blockchain

Absolute simplest approach

1. Version control existing theoretical models
2. Use applied examples from real research areas
3. 

"Version controllable specification for theory development and adjudication."
* Adjudication = testing empirical support
"Version controlled theories enable cumulative knowledge acquisition"
