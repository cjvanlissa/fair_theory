Action points:

Max will review paper and formalize Dunning-Kruger theory
Aaron will do experiments with trying to get theory indexed, and will submit review of PR, draft semantic versioning text
Andreas will help eliminate Issues
Caspar work on minimal example, more background on how to specify theories
Noah: read/review paper, provide relevant philosophical context?
Felix: Write about social process of how to use FAIR theory? Write about theory specification in line with your other paper? Help develop a worked example?

Priorities:

1. Philosophy
2. Implementation
3. Examples
4. Social process: we shouldn't ajudicate the quality of theories, but we should describe how people can operate on FAIR theories


Aaron: 

Not clear how to proceed with getting theories indexed

Meeting with CrossRef/Google Scholar infrastructure people

What should metadata look like?
* We need a metadata standard
* CFF? To align with crossref
* Maybe also need YAML standard that extends CFF

Andreas

* Conceptual layer VS implementation layer
* We use the platforms to have now (which all support keywords)

Aaron

* Create a FAIR theory and then CITE IT so it gets indexed
* Have another look at the definition of theory

Andreas

* Implementation is not so important
* Debate converging
* Give example of development of a theory over time
		+ Jan Feld Dunning-Kruger
		

If everyone worked FAIR from the start, Dunning-Kruger would have their verbal theory FAIR already

Caspar:

* We should mention machine-readable hypotheses and continuous integration as a way to continuously arbitrate between candidate theories

Noah:

* No priorities to add
* Willing to update from philosophy perspective
* Your theory is only a phenomenon - that's fine; as long as people represent it FAIRly then a proper theory that explains the phenomenon could be developed and reference it
