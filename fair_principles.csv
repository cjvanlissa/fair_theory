F1,(Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier,"Software and its associated metadata have a global, unique and persistent identifier for each released version","Theory and its associated metadata has a global, unique and persistent identifier for each version (using semantic versioning)",Rephrased,Rephrased
F2,Data are described with rich metadata,Software is described with rich metadata,Theory is described with rich metadata,Rephrased,~same
F3,Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes,Metadata clearly and explicitly include identifiers for all the versions of the software it describes,Metadata clearly and explicitly include identifiers for all the versions of the theory it describes,Rephrased and extended,~same
F4,(Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource,Software and its associated metadata are included in a searchable software registry,Theory and its associated metadata are included in a searchable repository,Rephrased,"NEEDS WORK! GitHub is indexed by Google I believe, but ideally, we'd like our theories to show up in Google Scholar, or even dedicated academic search enginges. Where could we put them to realize this?"
A1,(Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol,Software and its associated metadata are accessible by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol,Theory and its associated metadata are accessible by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol,Rephrased,~same
A1.1,"The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable","The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable","The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable",Remain the same,Same
A1.2,"The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary","The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary","The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary",Remain the same,Do  we need this?
A2,"Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available","Software metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available","Theory metadata are accessible, even when the theory is no longer available",Rephrased,Do  we need this?
I1,"(Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation","Software and its associated metadata use a formal, accessible, shared and broadly applicable language to facilitate machine readability and data exchange","Theory and its associated metadata use a formal, accessible, shared and broadly applicable language to facilitate machine readability and reuse",Rephrased and extended,Rephrased
I2,(Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles,- ,(Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles,"Reinterpreted, extended and split",NEEDS WORK! I think this is where we explain the value of e.g. universal graph languages like Aaron and Max'
I2S.1,-,Software and its associated metadata are formally described using controlled vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles,,"Reinterpreted, extended and split",
I2S.2,-,Software use and produce data in types and formats that are formally described using controlled vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles,,"Reinterpreted, extended and split",
I3,(Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data,-,"(Meta)data includes qualified references to other (meta)data, including previous versions of the theory",Discarded,Rephrased. I envision a LinkList-like structure where each theory version references its ancestor
I4S,-,Software dependencies are documented and mechanisms to access them exist,,Newly proposed,Discard
R1,(Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes,Software and its associated metadata are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes,Theory and its associated metadata are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes,Rephrased,Needs work. How do we envision this? Keywords? ISBN-like codes for variable type?
R1.1,(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license,"Software and its associated metadata have independent, clear and accessible usage licenses compatible with the software dependencies",(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible license,Rephrased and extended,Needs work: which license is good for theory?
R1.2,(Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance,"Software metadata include detailed provenance, detail level should be community agreed",(Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance,Rephrased,"Relates to I3; I think this point relates more to the theory's ancestry, and I3 relates to e.g. incorporating other theories within a theory (e.g., theory of measurement inside of structural theory)"
R1.3,(Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards,Software metadata and documentation meet domain-relevant community standards,Theory metadata and documentation meet domain-relevant community standards,Rephrased,These standards do not yet exist; we can take a first step towards developing them and recommend that this be an active area of development
